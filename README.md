# Computer-Vision-Project
Linear Regression for Face Recognition

The project is to create an automatic face recognition system using computer vision software that can recognize faces in images. The images will be divided into training and test data, with different images used for each. The Linear Regression Classification (LRC) Algorithm. The training set will have 40x5 photos, and the test set will have 40x5 images, with each subject having five images in each set.
